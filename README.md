Bootstrapify 3.0
=================

**Note:** 3.0 is a refactoring of 2.0 to convert to Bootstrap 3. Feel free to fork and submit pull-requests or submit an issue if you find something not working.

Bootstrapify is an open-source base theme for [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com?ref=lucid-design) that makes it super quick and easy for developers to start building amazing, responsive themes without having to do all the fiddly, repetitive setup work when starting from scratch.

You can view the WIP site at http://bootstrapify-theme.myshopify.com/?preview_theme_id=4630043.

Quick start
-----------

Download the repo and install it in your Shopify site or, *better yet,* clone it and use the excellent Shopify Theme gem (https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_theme)

Needless to say, we couldn't have done this without the awesome [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) project which this is based on.

Huge huge respect and many thanks for what these guys have created!
