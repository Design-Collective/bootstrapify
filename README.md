Bootstrapify
=================

Bootstrapify is an open-source base theme for Shopify that makes it super quick and easy for developers to start building amazing, responsive themes without having to do all the fiddly, repetitive setup work when starting from scratch.

While the open-source base has the full Twitter Bootstrap look-and-feel, this theme actually forms the foundation for Lucid One, our first premium responsive theme available in the Theme Store at http://themes.shopify.com/themes/lucid-one?ref=lucid-design

We are currently actively developing version 2.0 and are rebuilding it from scratch. Check out https://github.com/luciddesign/bootstrapify/issues?milestone=1&state=open and feel free to submit issues and requests.

Quick start
-----------

Download the repo and install it in your Shopify site or, *better yet,* clone it and use the excellent Shopify Theme gem (https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_theme)

Credits

Needless to say, we couldn't have done this without the awesome [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) project which this is based on.

Huge huge respect and many thanks for what these guys have created!
